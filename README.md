<p>This repo contains code for a simple shell built on C.</p>

<p>After cloning this repo, cd into the folder and compile the code with a C compiler.</p>
<p>For example with gcc, you can use -  gcc main.h *.c -o hsh.</p>
<p>Then you can run the shell in interactive mode by running this command - ./hsh</p>
<p>Or in non interactive-mode, for example - echo pwd | ./hsh</p>
