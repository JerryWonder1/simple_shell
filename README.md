This repo contains code for a simple shell built on C.  

After cloning this repo, cd into the folder and compile the code with a C compiler.  
For example with gcc, you can use -  `gcc main.h *.c -o hsh`.  
Then you can run the shell in interactive mode by running this command - `./hsh`  
Or in non interactive-mode, for example - `echo pwd | ./hsh`  

This project is written by Joseph Jeremiah and Ibrahim Ahmed.
